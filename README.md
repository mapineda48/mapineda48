# ðŸ‘‹ Hi 

I am a full-stack web developer with experience in Node.js and React.js, using TypeScript on both sides of the stack for several years and currently focusing on SRE and DevOps culture.

I have experience working on Node.js projects creating scalable and reliable web applications using tools such as Express, Next JS, and MongoDB. I have also worked with React.js to create attractive and user-friendly interfaces. I have developed skills in software architecture design, performance optimization, and scalability.

Using TypeScript on both sides of the stack has allowed me to increase productivity and code quality by providing better support for typing and documentation.

Currently, I am interested in the field of SRE and DevOps culture, and I am learning about tools and techniques to improve availability, scalability, and security of systems. I am confident that these skills will help me continue growing as a developer and help my teams achieve their goals.
